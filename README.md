> **Looking for a typescript version ? Check out the original creator of this boilerplate at [cra-lerna-electron](https://github.com/amaurymartiny/cra-lerna-electron)** 

Minimal starter kit: ⚛️ [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + 🐉 [`Lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) + :electron: [`Electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron) + ES6 (2019)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Fetch this repo
git clone https://github.com/ganzf/cra-lerna-electron-es6 my-app
cd my-app

# Bootstrap the Lerna project, will install all modules
yarn install
```

## Folder structure

The main idea of this starer kit is to separate the Electron and React parts, as well as having packages for common modules, react components and an ES6 compatible express server.
